This is website for the time being. We could probably host it elsewhere in the future.
For the sake of making a simple website for showing off our ideas to the sponsor, this should suffice.

The website is NOT currently live through GH Pages since it's not ready for the public. If it were, you could access it at [PSU-CS-Wildfire-Capstone-Sp-S-25.github.io](PSU-CS-Wildfire-Capstone-Sp-S-25.github.io)
